# 01_NeuralNetworkRegressionWithTensorFlow

## Overview

This project provides an introduction to regression problems using neural networks implemented with TensorFlow. The main objective is to demonstrate how neural networks can be used to predict continuous numerical values (regression tasks) based on one or more input features.

The code and explanations are contained in the Jupyter notebook: [`01_NeuralNetworkRegressionWithTensorFlow.ipynb`](./01_NeuralNetworkRegressionWithTensorFlow.ipynb).

## Background

Regression is a fundamental type of supervised machine learning task where the goal is to predict continuous, real-valued outcomes. This project simplifies the concept by demonstrating how to use TensorFlow to build, train, and evaluate a neural network for regression tasks.

---

## What is a Regression Problem?

A regression problem involves modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). In this notebook, you will find:

- Conceptual explanation of regression tasks
- Discussion of common use cases
- Visual aids for better understanding

---

## Neural Network Anatomy

The notebook also covers the basic anatomy of neural networks, including:

- Layers (input, hidden, output)
- Activation functions
- Model compilation and training
- Model evaluation

---

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies (see below). The main code and explanations are in the Jupyter notebook.

---

## How to Run

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnilKumarSingh9856/01_NeuralNetworkRegressionWithTensorFlow.git
   cd 01_NeuralNetworkRegressionWithTensorFlow
   ```

2. **(Recommended) Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
